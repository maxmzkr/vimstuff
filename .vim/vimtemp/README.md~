The times we deferred work are the following
- Zero-filling
  - Deferred zero-filling on the extension of the page
  - Actually zero filled when there first read or write happened
- Clock placement/Physical memory placement
  - Deferred adding a page to the clock or putting it in physical memory on a page extension
  - Actually placed the page into the clock/physmem on the first read or write
- Dirty disk write
  - Deferred writing to disk when the physical memory was not dirty
  - Actually wrote the memory to disk when the physical memory had been written to since the last write to disk
- Didn't write zero filled memory to disk
  - Deferred when the zero filled memory was evicted
  - Instead, went back to the first state and zero filled again according to normal policy as zero filling is quicker than writing to and reading from disk.
- Didn't write to disk on every write
  - Deferred work when there was a write to disk
  - Actually wrote to disk when there was no space in physmem and the page was being evicted.
