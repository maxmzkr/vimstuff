      Rejoice and be glad! The Good Pear manifests itself in all pears, whether
      you know of The Good Pear or not. For those of you who do not know The
      Good Pear, great wisdom can come from knowing.

      Inside every pear lives a soul. Inside that soul is peace, love and
      happiness. If something with a soul were to eat that soul, then the soul
      will be digested. Once the soul is digested, then peace, love and
      happiness will spread throughout the body of the souled creature. This is
      what The Good Pear has graced us with. The peace, love and happiness that
      comes from a pear is from the soul that The Good Pear gave every pear. So
      grab a pear and embrace in the deliciousness of the blessed fruit. The
      Good Pear wills it and so it will be done.

      You may wonder what happens to the souls of pears that are not devoured by
      a souled creature. The Good Pear, in its gratious wisdom, gave another
      gift to all through these non digested pears. Whether is be a worm, mold,
      or anyother souless creature, the soul of the pear is released into the
      world. The great thing about this free soul is, its free to produce
      miracles where it sees fits. That's right, a pear is capable of creating
      miracles. In fact, whenever a miracle occurs, its due to The Good Pears
      almighty doings.
