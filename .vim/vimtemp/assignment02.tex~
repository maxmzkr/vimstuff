% Name the type of conditioning
The planner in Mrs.\ Stallings classroom suggesting that the class decrease the amount of attention Peter gets during his outbursts is an example of negative punishment operant conditioning~\cite{PETER}.
% Define the key elements of this type of conditioning
This example meets all of the key elements of this type of conditioning.
Firstly, it is operant conditioning because Peter is learning how to behave based on consequences of his actions~\cite{LECTURE}.
In this case, what he is learning is to not have outbursts, and the consequence of bad behavior is losing attention.
Secondly, The type of operant conditioning is negative because it involves the removal of stimulus~\cite{SCHACTER}.
The stimulus being the attention he is receiving.
Finally, The conditioning is also punishment because it decreases the the behavior that led to the removal of the stimulus~\cite{SCHACTER}.
% Name the type of conditioning
On the other hand, when the planner suggest that the class give Peter a lot of attention when he is doing what he is supposed to do, she is suggesting the class use positive reinforcement operant conditioning.
% Define the key elements of this type of conditioning
Once again the example meets all of the key elements of this type of conditioning.
It is operant conditioning, again, because Peter is learning how to behave due to the consequences of his behavior~\cite{LECTURE}.
The behavior that Peter is learning, in this case, is to do what he is supposed to be doing and the consequence is more attention.
Beyond operant conditioning, this is positive conditioning because the stimulus is being presented as a consequence to the action~\cite{SCHACTER}.
The stimulus being the attention Peter gets.
The condition is also reinforcement because the goal is to increase the amount of time Peter spends doing what he is supposed to~\cite{SCHACTER}.
% Define observational learning.
The class benefited from observational learning by observing this conditioning.
Observational learning being learning that happens by observing the behavior of others and the consequences of that behavior~\cite{SCHACTER}.
% Give a specific example of how observational learning also occurs when the types of conditioning described in 1.a and 1.b are being demonstrated in the video, make sure to support your response
The class learned how to respect Peter by observing the attention Peter received when he was kind and the attention he lost when he was rude.
Peter was learning how to be respectful.
When he was kind to other students, the students saw him get rewarded with attention.
The students learned that being kind was what they should do.
When he was not being respectful, he was punished.
This let the students learn through observation to be respectful.
We see the students show what they learned during the scene when Peter is kicking the soccer ball and everyone is cheering ``Go Peter!''~\cite{PETER}



% Provide a brief description of the findings from What You Expect is What You Get
The article from the Hock text, \textit{What You Expect is What You Get}, described an experiment where the researchers told teachers that certain random students were more capable than others.
The students that the teachers believed would succeed in class were the ones that generally did better, even if the teachers beliefs had no basis.
This shows that the expectations of a teacher or a researcher can greatly affect the out come of a study or the performance of a student.
The researchers also found that the older the students were, the less of an effect the intelligence predictors had on the students' performance.
While the researchers have many predictions on why this is, the study was not able to explain the exact reasoning~\cite{HOCK}.
% Give a specific example of Mrs. Stallings' academic expectations for Peter.
Mrs.\ Stallings gave Peter many expectations.
We see one such expectation when Mrs.\ Stallings says that she changed her expectations of Peter part way through the year.
She says that at first she was not confident that Peter could do some of the things that she wanted him to do.
She later realized that he could do what she wanted him to do~\cite{PETER}.
During this time she was trying to get Peter to say what was the subject of different pictures~\cite{PETER}.
Had she had her original expectations she would have simply let Peter get away with not doing the work.
Instead, she expected Peter to do the work, so Peter did the work.
This is an example of Peter performing according to Mrs.\ Stallings expectations.
% Explain how Peter's behavior in response to Mrs. Stallings' expectations relates to Rosenthal and Jacobson's findings
The Rosenthal and Jacobson's findings showed that students would perform to the teacher's expectations.
Had Mrs.\ Stallings not expected Peter to be able to do the work Peter would have stopped doing work and learned nothing.
Instead, Peter continued with the work and probably learned something from it.
This fits in exactly with what the Rosenthal and Jacobson's findings showed.
Mrs.\ Stallings expected Peter to do work and Peter did work.
What Mrs.\ Stallings expected is what she got.

% Define conceptual skills
Conceptual skills involve spoken language and written language.
It also involves the knowledge of money, time and numbers as well as the ability to self-direct~\cite{LECTURE2}.
% Give an example of a conceptual skill that Peter has
Peter shows he has conceptual skills relating to written language.
During the movie Peter reads a bit of text in front of the class~\cite{PETER}.
Peter's ability to read is a conceptual skill.
% Define social skills
Social skill are skills that involve working with others and functioning in a society.
It involves things such as interpersonal skills and rule and law following~\cite{LECTURE2}.
% Given an example of a social skill that Peter has
Peter was very capable of expressing his affection for others.
Near the end we see Peter hugging another student as the teacher says that it was difficult for Peter to leave his friends~\cite{PETER}.
This shows that Peter had interpersonal skills.
Conveying emotions to others is an interpesonal social skill.
% Define practicle skills
Practical skills are skills that relate to daily living.
These include occupational skills, the care of ones health, the ability to keep a schedule, and the ability to keep ones self safe~\cite{LECTURE2}.
% Give an example of a practicle skill that Peter has.
We see Peter show some of his practical skills in the lunch line.
Peter goes through the lunch line and picks out his food~\cite{PETER}.
Getting food is a way of taking care of ones health.
Peter's ability to get nourishment is very much a practical skill.

% Discuss how you believe Peter's abilities were changed as a result of being in Mrs. Stallings' class
Peter's abilities were greatly changed as a result of being in Mrs.\ Stallings' class.
By putting Peter in a mainstream class Peter was expected to interact with others in a well behaved way.
This expectation setting helped lead Peter to be a well behaved child.
Putting Peter in a non mainstream class would be the same as expecting Peter to never be able to succeed.
If this were the expectation, Peter may have never learned the many social skills that he learned in the mainstream class.
